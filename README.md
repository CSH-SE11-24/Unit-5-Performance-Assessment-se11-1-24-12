1.) Functionality of the website (descriptions of each of the pages and what they do)
home page is just a slide with a tad bit of context and the top news this month!


 2.)How did JavaScript expand the functionality of your website?
 It helped me change the background of the pages, plus made my website look neater

3.)What features are you the most proud of?
mouse over + mouse out

4.)What would you add if you had more time?
 I would add way more stories and context, i found it difficult to design a news page especially because there's too much going on sometimes and can be a tad bit messy
